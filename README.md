First simple website

This repository includes my first website (on-line portfolio) made using Html5 and CSS3. This website was prepared based on Miros≈Çaw Zelent's tutorial:
http://miroslawzelent.pl/kurs-html/przyjazne-adresy-linkowanie-podstron-fontello/
There were implemented some changes to show that website was prepared on my own with fully understanding of the topic not only just by coping.

Project consists of main page with small introduction and 4 subpages. Print screens were included in file My_first_website.pdf so it is possible to have a quick overwiev of it but I encourage you to activate it also in your brawser.

Have a pleasure rewieving!
